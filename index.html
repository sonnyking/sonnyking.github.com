        <h3>A bit about myself</h3>
        <p>
          I’m a passionate technologist with an eye for design that brings 16 years experience crafting high fidelity user experiences to my role of Principal Design Technologist at frog. A UI/UX specialist with a broad yet deep skill set I’ve contributed to the successful delivery of a large number of innovation programs as well as consumer facing properties for clients such as AT&T, Chase, Disney, GE, Intel, Mozilla and Telstra among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical background is diverse and modern leveraging advanced UI/UX technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, WebGL, ActionScript, Lua tied to Node.js, Ruby and Java backends. This expertise translates well to other smaller form factor embedded platforms/systems with web/markup UX stacks sitting atop low-level C cores. While not normally considered a Software Architect or Engineer per se I’m very comfortable contributing to delivery focused programs in similar capacities leveraging test/behavior driven development, Agile processes and modern best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to joining frog I was the Director of Multimedia Technology in the interactive practice at 22Squared, a large independent advertising agency servicing Fortune 500 clients across the country. An enthusiastic design technology evangelist I’ve enjoyed opportunities to share my passion with others, as Adjunct Professor of Web Development at Southern Polytechnic University and by assisting enterprises and individuals to broaden their exposure to progressive, forward thinking practices whenever possible.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    
        <h4>Principle Design Technologist – frog design 10/2007 - present</h4>
    
        <p>
          Design collaborator, delivery facilitator frog technologists partner in a creative process that ensures product innovation and market realization. Acting as technology lead or an individual contributor I’ve had the pleasure of working ahead of the curve, often defining what the next generation of digital products might encompass. Non-disclosure agreements prevent me from providing detailed information however; I can say that I’ve had the pleasure of participating in many award-winning projects during my time at frog for a wonderful group of clients.  
        </p>

        <h4>Design Technology Consultant - AT&T 3/05 – 7/2007</h4>
        <p>
          Key team member of the BellSouth/AT&T support team for online services (Broadband/Dial-up) tasked with lowering support related call volume and increasing customer satisfaction. Collaborated with internal and external stakeholders advocating the use of user centric design principles to deliver intuitive experiences that ultimately allowed users to guide themselves in their self-help journey.
        </p>

        <h4>Director, Multimedia Technology – 22squared 4/00 – 3/02</h4>
        <p>
          Leader of a cross-disciplinary team tasked with delivering immersive interactive advertising solutions in a fast paced creative environment servicing a large portfolio of clients ranging from Fortune 500 corporations to agile startups. I was responsible for day to day management of Software Architects, Web/Interactive Developers and Designers as well as being a key member of the agency’s new business team responsible for winning contracts in excess of $10 MM USD.
        </p>

        <h4>Adjunct Professor, Web Development – Southern Polytechnic State University  04/00 – 03/02</h4>
        <p>
          Primary instructor of the technology track of the Web Development Certificate Program lecturing postgraduate students in the art of modern web design and development techniques using HTML 4, JavaScript 1.2 and Adobe Flash
        </p>

        <h4>Webmaster – Online Insight  4/99 – 4/00</h4>
        <p>
          As a component of the marketing group I was responsible for the development of Online Insight's web properties and a key stakeholder in the strategic development of web/interactive marketing of our software products. A venture capitalist funded startup Online Insight developed next generation market analysis tools that embed in e-commerce engines capturing valuable data from customer transactions in real time. This allowed organizations such as Dell to drive business analytics at a much faster pace than traditional heuristic user research that measured change in physical quarters rather than days/weeks.
        </p>

        <h4>Design Technologist – Kauka Communications  4/94 – 4/99 </h4>
        <p>
          Fascinated by computer animation I was thrilled to have the opportunity to join Michael Kauka's small marketing agency Kauka Communications. Michael was the son of Rolf Kauka, famed German cartoonist and to many the European equivalent of Walt Disney.
        </p>
        <p>
          While focused on using emerging technology to create meaningful dialog with audiences Michael understood the relationship between the new technology and the handcrafted animation techniques that his father employed for many years. I was fortunate enough to be taught these traditional skills as a foundation to the digital animation that was the focus of my job description at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As multimedia technology evolved throughout the 90's the practice and my role within it grew. Initially focused on user interface design and animation our products become more complex and I found that I had a passion for the inner workings that powered interaction. I learned how to author CD-ROMs using Director, create website's with HTML, JavaScript and Perl and use what at the time was a little known product called Flash to create interactive media distributed on floppy disks.
